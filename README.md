# SNS: Streams and Stats

Personal experiment: streaming live videos from across the web, and delivering their stats.

## Intro

`SNS` is a SPA (short for Single Page App) that provides a list of streams based off JSON files. And at the same time.

Across the project I tried to make it as modular as possible, but of course there is plenty more that can be done regarding this.
